7-Day MVP Plan

Daughter tasks (UX, wording, testing)

Day 1
- Review the Home, Report, and Map page text for clarity and kindness.
- Suggest small wording edits that feel welcoming and easy for all ages.
- Draft a short version of the safety disclaimer in plain language.

Day 2
- Sketch the layout of the Report form (fields only, no tech details).
- Decide the order of questions so it feels quick and gentle.
- Write friendly helper text for each field (species, condition, description, location).

Day 3
- Create example reports (3 to 5) using simple descriptions and locations.
- Check that each example matches the SPEC.md fields and tones.

Day 4
- Test the pages for readability on a phone and a laptop.
- Note any confusing words or long sentences to simplify.

Day 5
- Review the Map page wording to ensure it feels supportive, not urgent.
- Confirm the language avoids encouraging risky actions.

Day 6
- Read the full site flow (Home -> Report -> Map) and point out any gaps.
- Suggest short success or confirmation wording for after a report is submitted.

Day 7
- Final pass on all text for consistency and compassion.
- Write a short list of “what feels good” and “what feels unclear.”

Parent tasks (technical wiring)

Day 1
- Confirm the three routes render and the navigation links work.
- Ensure global styles keep text readable and layout calm.

Day 2
- Add the Report form structure with fields from SPEC.md (no backend yet).
- Include labels and placeholder text matching the daughter’s wording.

Day 3
- Add a simple in-memory data structure for example reports (temporary).
- Render example reports on the Map page as a list (no real map yet).

Day 4
- Add a basic report detail view on the Map page list (expandable section).
- Ensure it shows species, condition, time, and description.

Day 5
- Add a static “Nearby shelters and vets” section tied to the example reports.
- Include name and distance placeholders only.

Day 6
- Add a simple confirmation message after form submission (front-end only).
- Ensure the report appears in the list immediately (still in-memory).

Day 7
- Verify acceptance criteria from SPEC.md are met in the UI.
- Do a final pass for clarity, safety disclaimer, and compassionate tone.
